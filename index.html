                <p>Amman, the modern and ancient capital of Jordan, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the World.
                    The city's modern buildings blend with the remnants of ancient civilizations. The profusion of gleaming white
                     houses, old souqs, kebab stalls with roasting meat, and tiny cafes where rich Arabian coffee is sipped in the
                      afternoon sunshine, conjure a mood straight from a thousand and one nights.

                   Recent excavations have uncovered homes and towers believed to have been built during the Stone Age with many
                    references to it in the Bible. It was known in the Old Testament as Rabbath-Ammon, the capital of the Ammonites
                     around 1200 BC, it was also referred to as "the City of Waters".

                <p>In Greco-Roman times in the 3rd century BC, the City was renamed Philadelphia (Greek for "The Brotherhood Love")
                    after the Ptolemaic ruler Philadelphus (283-246 BC). The City later came under Seleucid as well as Nabataean
                     rule until the Roman General Pompey annexed Syria and made Philadelphia part of the Decapolis League - a loose 
                     alliance of ten free city-states, bound by powerful commercial, political, and cultural interests under overall
                      allegiance to Rome.

                   Under the influence of the Roman culture, Philadelphia was reconstructed in typically grand Roman style with
                    colonnaded streets, baths, an Amphitheater, and impressive public buildings.
                   
                   During the Byzantine period, Philadelphia was the seat of a Christian Bishop, and therefore several churches
                    were built. The city declined somewhat until the year 635 AD. As Islam spread northwards from the Arabian
                     Peninsula, the land became part of its domain. Its original Semitic name Ammon or Amman was returned to it.
                   
                   Amman's modern history began in the late 19th Century, when the Ottomans resettled a colony of Circassian
                    emigrants in 1878. As the Great Arab Revolt progressed and the State of Transjordan was established, Emir 
                    Abdullah ibn Al-Hussein founder of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan made Amman his capital in 1921. Since then,
                     Amman has grown rapidly into a modern, thriving metropolis of well over two million people.</p>
